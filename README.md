# Express.js Async Request Handling and Timeout

This repository demonstrates a potential issue in Express.js applications when handling asynchronous operations within request handlers.  If an asynchronous operation takes longer than the client is willing to wait, it can lead to a timeout or a failed response.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problem: a 5-second delay is simulated using `setTimeout`. In a real application, this could be a database query, an external API call, or another lengthy process.

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a solution using proper asynchronous handling and error management to mitigate the problem.
